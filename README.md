:diamond_shape_with_a_dot_inside: A fully automated process for rapid and reliable identification of ECE across diverse MRI datasets.

We present a novel DL strategy that utilizes lightweight CNNs for the effective detection of ECE in preoperative MRI scans of PCa patients through a fully automated process. Our development, AutoRadAI, is a comprehensive, fully automated pipeline designed for ECE detection. It integrates two advanced DL models, ProSliceFinder and ExCapNet, alongside a systematic framework for processing and refining images—from the radiologist's bench to generating outcomes that are easily interpretable by medical professionals. We aim to streamline and enhance the diagnostic workflow by developing a user-friendly, end-to-end pipeline as its core. This application, designed for clinical use, will facilitate rapid and reliable identification of ECE across diverse MRI datasets, improving both accuracy and consistency in diagnoses. This new approach aims to enhance patient management by promoting early diagnostic intervention and supporting more precise treatment planning, ultimately contributing to the advancement of patient care.
